# Secondary School Projects: St. Joseph's Convent

Welcome to the first chapter of my programming journey! This section of my portfolio contains the projects and exercises I completed during my secondary school studies at St. Joseph's Convent. These works represent my foundational steps into the world of software development.

*The IT SBA is my major project from secondary school, demonstrating my ability to plan, develop, and document a complete software solution across multiple disciplines.*

## Main Projects

The `Main Projects` directory contains the most substantial assignments from my secondary school years. These projects, including my Information Technology School-Based Assessment (SBA), were my first attempts at building more complete and robust applications. They demonstrate my early problem-solving skills and my ability to manage a larger codebase.

## Small Exercises

The `Small Exercises` directory is a collection of code snippets, class assignments, and practice exercises. While smaller in scope, these pieces highlight the foundational concepts I learned in algorithms, data structures, and programming logic. They represent the daily practice and learning that built my skills over time.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this section were primarily developed using technologies that were part of my secondary school curriculum, including:
- Pascal (using Eazy Pascal)
- C/C++ (using Code::Blocks)
- Microsoft Access (for I.T. SBA databases)
- Microsoft Excel (for I.T. SBA reports and spreadsheets)
