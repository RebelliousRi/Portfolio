              The Pitons are two volcanic spires located on the southwest coast

            <p>
              The Diamond Falls Botanical Gardens is one of the most beautiful
              and tranquil attractions in Saint Lucia. Located in Soufrière, the
              gardens are home to a wide variety of tropical plants and flowers.
              The centerpiece of the gardens is the Diamond Waterfall, which is
              fed by sulphur springs and changes colors due to mineral deposits.
              The gardens also feature mineral baths that were originally built
              for King Louis XVI of France. It's a perfect place to relax, take
              a leisurely stroll, and immerse yourself in the island's natural
              beauty.
