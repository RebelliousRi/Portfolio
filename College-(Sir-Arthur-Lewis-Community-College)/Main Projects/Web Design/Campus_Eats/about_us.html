    <h3>Why We Built Campus Eats </h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to Campus Eats, your one-stop shop for seamless food ordering on campus.
      We understand what it means to be constantly juggling between tight class

      food-ordering easier for students, lecturers, staff, and visitors. Our
      platform offers menus updated from different food outlets and allows you to
      browse, order, and track your meals with ease anywhere-whether you are racing
      between classes or relaxing off-campus. With the ability to leave reviews,
      we guarantee that you will have your say in the dining experience and help
      others make the right choices.</p>
