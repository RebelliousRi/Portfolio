# Arianna St. John's Programming Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a curated journey through my programming career, from my earliest projects in secondary school to my most recent work. It's a collection of projects and exercises that showcase my growth and dedication to coding.

## About This Portfolio

I've separated my work into two main categories to make it easy to explore:

### 1. Main Projects
These are my more robust and feature-rich applications. They demonstrate my ability to build and maintain complete software solutions.

### 2. Small Exercises
These are smaller scripts and activities. While more trivial, they highlight the sheer volume of coding I've done over the years through coursework, challenges, and personal learning.
